# stx-box-office-application
Full-Stack application developed for STX Entertainment to help their advertising team compile box office data programmatically through the Opus API. Unfortanetely, the client did not adopt the application due to the emergence of IMDbPro which included similar features at a lower cost than competitive data providers.
