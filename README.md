# Box Office Data Compiler for STX Entertainment

![Example 1](./demo.gif)

===================

## Description

Full-Stack application developed for STX Entertainment to help their advertising team compile box office data programmatically through the [Opus API](https://www.opusdata.com/). Unfortanetely, the client did not adopt the application due to the emergence of [IMDbPro](https://pro.imdb.com/signup/index.html?rf=google_brand_us_187248834&ref_google_brand_us_187248834&gclid=Cj0KCQjw-_j1BRDkARIsAJcfmTHsItQNaoOife3lt70a-MADUkm_F-EvpWhLADVXoCp2vexDvBDNPsYaAqnrEALw_wcB) which included similar features at a lower cost than competitive data providers. 

## Functionality

The client was able to query and filter the data by movie title, weekend or genre. Advanced filters included looking for movies above a certain level of revenue broken out by day, week or weekends only. In addition, subgenre filters and data range selectors were also available in the UI. 

The application is no longer active due to expiration of the Opus API's data token trial period. However, pleae find the deployed application [HERE](http://stx-box-office.herokuapp.com) to review CSS and HTML structure if desired. 

## Process

We began by researching different movie database APIs - ranging from Fandango, to IMDB's, to boxofficemojo.com's data feed. Every API that we encountered did not give us daily box office information until we found OpusData. 

We contacted OpusData, and they gave us sample files that showed box office numbers by day, week, and genre. This was excellent news, however, we did not realize how difficult it would be to make API calls to their server.

After about a week of trying to make AJAX calls, our instructors referred us to [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) which was still foreign to our student cohort at the time. Once we learned node.js in less than a week, we modified the response and sent data back and forth between our frontend and backend to meet our delivery deadline. 

## Credits

Our UCLA Extension instructor, Omar Patel, helped us integrate node.js and heroku deployment. OpusData.com supplied the response data.
